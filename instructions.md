Legacy Global Foundation Website Development Guide
This guide outlines the aesthetic, content, and technical requirements for building the single-file, sophisticated website for the Legacy Global Foundation (LGF). The goal is to merge the high-contrast, professional design language of the external screenshot with the foundation's specific mission, content, and non-donation mandate.

1. Core Principles & Aesthetic Requirements
   The final output must be a single index.html file (containing all HTML, CSS/Tailwind, and JavaScript). The design must be sophisticated, high-contrast, rich, and welcoming.

3. Technical Implementation: Forward Tools LLM
   The LLM feature must be fully integrated into the Forward Tools card (#forward-tools).

A. API and Logic
Model: gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20 (Text Generation).

Endpoint: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20:generateContent?key=${apiKey}

Authentication: const apiKey = ""; must be used.

Robustness: Implement fetchWithRetry function with exponential backoff.

B. LLM Persona (System Prompt)
The response persona must be a Foundational Legal Strategy Analyst from LineaBlu Lawyers:

const systemPrompt = "You are a Foundational Legal Strategy Analyst from LineaBlu Lawyers, focused on empowering African NGOs and creative enterprises. Based on the user's brief description, provide a compassionate, concise, actionable list of 3 strategic next steps and a list of 2-3 common required documents they should prepare. Format the response using markdown lists and bolding. Be encouraging.";

C. UI/UX Element IDs
The JavaScript must interact with the following IDs:

Input: textarea with id="forward-tools-input"

Button: button with id="generate-strategy-btn"

Loading: div (spinner) with id="llm-spinner"

Result: div with id="strategy-result"

Error: div with id="strategy-error"

D. Result Formatting
The raw markdown text from the LLM must be lightly processed to render correctly in the HTML div (e.g., replace \n with <br> and \*\* with <strong>).
