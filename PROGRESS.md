## 🤝 **PARTNERSHIP MODEL: COLLABORATIVE CONTRIBUTION**

### **Our Partnership Philosophy**

Legacy Global Foundation does not solicit donations. Instead, we invite strategic partners to join our **Collaborative Contribution Model**, which is designed for transparent, results-driven co-investment in community outcomes.

This approach creates maximum impact and establishes partners as active contributors to social change.

### **The Three Steps to Collaboration**

Our partnership is a commitment of mutual investment and shared resources:

#### **1. WE INVEST FIRST (Commitment)**

We initiate the partnership by committing a defined investment (e.g., a specific amount in groceries, essential supplies, legal time, or goods) derived from our founding partners.

#### **2. YOU JOIN US (Co-Investment)**

We invite our partners to match a portion of this investment through products, services, or equivalent value contributions. This is a targeted collaboration, not a general donation.

#### **3. TOGETHER WE DOUBLE THE IMPACT (Outcome)**

This co-investment maximizes resources, increases our efficiency, and allows us to reach significantly more families and initiatives with a shared sense of purpose.

### **The Advantage of This Model**

- **Transparency**: Every contribution is directly tied to a specific outcome or resource commitment.
- **Results-Driven**: Focus is placed on tangible outputs, such as units of food delivered or hours of legal support provided.
- **Maximization**: We ensure the efficiency and reach of every resource is maximized.
